## NLP

Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science - specifically Artificial Intelligence - and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with providing computers the ability to process data encoded in natural language, typically collected in text corpora, using either rule-based, statistical or neural-based approaches of machine learning and deep learning.
